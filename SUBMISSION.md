  - Clear summary of who pays whom and how much

- [x] **Data Validation & Error Handling**
  - Validate all inputs (positive amounts, required fields)
  - Handle edge cases gracefully
  - Return clear, helpful error messages
  - Proper HTTP status codes

### **API Endpoints**
- [x] `GET /expenses` - List all expenses
- [x] `POST /expenses` - Add new expense
- [x] `PUT /expenses/:id` - Update expense
- [x] `DELETE /expenses/:id` - Delete expense
- [x] `GET /settlements` - Get settlement summary
- [x] `GET /balances` - Show each person's balance
- [x] `GET /people` - List all people

### **Deployment & Testing**
- [x] Public Postman collection with working examples
- [x] Deployed backend with online database
- [x] All APIs work immediately upon import
- [x] Pre-populated with sample data (Shantanu, Sanket, Om)
- [x] Settlement calculations show realistic results

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack Used**
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Deployment**: Railway.app
- **Testing**: Postman

## üßÆ **Settlement Algorithm**
The settlement calculation uses a greedy algorithm that:
1. Calculates net balance for each person (paid - owed)
2. Separates people into debtors and creditors
3. Matches debtors with creditors to minimize transactions
4. Handles floating-point precision for accurate money calculations

## üìä **Sample Calculation**
With expenses:
- Dinner ‚Çπ600 (paid by Shantanu, split 3 ways = ‚Çπ200 each)
- Groceries ‚Çπ450 (paid by Sanket, split 3 ways = ‚Çπ150 each)
- Petrol ‚Çπ300 (paid by Om, split 3 ways = ‚Çπ100 each)

**Balances**:
- Shantanu: +‚Çπ150 (paid ‚Çπ600, owes ‚Çπ450)
- Sanket: +‚Çπ0 (paid ‚Çπ450, owes ‚Çπ450)
- Om: -‚Çπ150 (paid ‚Çπ300, owes ‚Çπ450)

**Settlement**: Om pays ‚Çπ150 to Shantanu

## üéØ **Key Features Demonstrated**
- **Smart Splitting**: Both equal splits and custom splits
- **Optimized Settlements**: Minimal transaction recommendations
- **Robust Validation**: Comprehensive error handling
- **Money Precision**: Proper floating-point handling
- **Production Ready**: Deployed with proper environment setup
